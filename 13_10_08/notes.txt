PHP Superglobals
$GLOBALS
$_SERVER
$_GET
	Holds only the variables from a GET request
$_POST
	Holds only the variables from a POST request
$_COOKIE
	Holds the variables which are in the client-side cookie.
	From the PHP.net comments: The value of $_COOKIE is determined by the content of cookies received in the user agent's request.  "If you set a cookie (ie send it to the browser), it won't be sent back until the next request and so the data won't be present in $_COOKIE."
		So...I can use setcookie() [see below]
$_FILES
$_ENV
$_REQUEST
	Super set of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.  Not really a great choice, since it obscures the workings/architecture of the website.
$_SESSION

htmlentities()
	PHP function to escape entirely to HTML equivalents.  For instance, angle brackets
isset($var)
	PHP function to check a function to see if it is null (true if exists and not null)
setcookie()
	sets a value in the client side cookie.  Must be before any HTML response.
