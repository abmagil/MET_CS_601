MET_CS_601
==========

All code generated as part of class 'MET CS 601'

Structure:
	Each class day will be allotted own folder or project, allowing me to create coherent code,
	while still keeping all classwork centrally located (both on disk and in GitHub)
	
Classwork will be XAMPP on Windows 7
	For XAMPP setup, download and install it wherever.  In /xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf, 
	change the DocumentRoot and Directory fields to '.../MET_CS_601' 
Project work will be Rails on Windows 7/Heroku (using Ruby 1.9.3, DevKit, Rails 4.0)
