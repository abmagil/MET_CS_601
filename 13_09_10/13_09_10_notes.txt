Review of CSS:
	.class
	#id
	
Talk about the HW: confirming that we're up and running

CSS: can link in, embed in HTML (in its own tag) or inline it (inside of modified tag)
	Cascade: Inline > Embedded > Linked (where ">" = "overrides")
	
Chrome DevTools: when looking at the CSS for an element, Chrome will show what CSS applied and what existed.  Overridden CSS will be struck through

<p> vs <div>: <p> has natural padding, whereas <div> does not.

"Unobtrusive JS/CSS": keep ONLY html in html files, apply events and CSS in their own files (JS and CSS respectively).
	-Ensures that HTML is just your structured material.  Just nouns. 

<header>: For structuring website.  Can place h* into header tag, in fact, intended to wrap them.  Can also include navigational aids
	mock up with CSS for backwards compatibility: "header{ display:block}"
<section>: generic container tag.  Meant to be invisible to user, so DO NOT style, make main content area.
	-Tabs in website
	-segments of an "About us"
	-pieces of a Terms of Service.
	-Rule of thumb for use: A section has semantic meaning; it implies that all of its content is related or grouped.
<article>: composition that forms an INDEPENDENT portion of a document.  For instance, a forum post/comment, a widget
	-a specialized kind of <section> which has additional semantic meaning (independence)
<nav>: A grouping of navigation links.  Additional semantic purpose.  Should replace <div id="nav"> only.
	-Table of contents
	-Previous/next buttons
	-Breadcrumb navigation
<aside>: Used to relate a block to something adjacent.  NOT for sidebars holding major content.
<footer>: A footer

Forms
	GET limits: 2048k (varies by browser.  IE has the lowest.)
	Without "action": form reloads
	Without "method": GET used
