Question 1.
a. Show how to code an unordered list, use any list marker you want.   You must use at least 3 list items.
	<ul>
		<li>This is my first item.</li>
		<li><p>List items can contain many other tags.</p></li>
		<li>But I don't know exactly how they interplay...</li>
	</ul>

b. Show how to code an ordered list, again, using any list marker you want. You must use at least 3 list items.
	<ol>
		<li>This is also a first item.  But unlike in the ul tag, it has an order.</li>
		<li>In this case, that means a number.</li>
		<li>But it could be changed to other things, like letters.</li>
	</ol>
	
c. Show how to properly code nested lists:  one list must be ordered, the other, unordered. You must use at least list items.
	<ol>
		<li>This will be a 1.
			<ul>
				<li>This will have a bullet point</li>
				<li>So will this</li>
				<li>Because they are directly contained in a ul.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This will be a 2.
			<ul>
				<li>This will have a bullet point</li>
				<li>So will this</li>
				<li>You get the drill.</li>

	</ol>
	
d. Show how to code description lists.  You must use at least 3 list items.

e. Show how you change the list markers using CSS for an unordered list.   You must use at least 3 list items.

		}
	</style>
	<ul class="square">
		<li>This is my first item.</li>

		<li>This is also a first item.  But unlike in the ul tag, it has an order.</li>
		<li>In this case, that means a lower-case letter.</li>
		<li>But it could be changed to other things, like numbers.</li>
	</ol>
	
g. Show how you change the alignment (padding, margin, etc) of an unordered list using CSS.  You must use at least 3 list items.

	</style>
	<ul>This is the title of my list.
