			<p>We're sorry to see you go, but we hope in the long run, you'll realize your deep mistakes and come back.</p>
			<p>To be clear, I'm not talking about the mistake you've made of leaving this site.  I mean, obviously that was a mistake, but no, I'm talking about all the mistakes you've made in life.</p>
			<ul>For example:
				<li>Your choice in school.</li>
				<li>Your choice in friends.</li>
				<li>Your choice in school.</li>
				<li>Your choice in parents.  Yes.  Parents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But don't feel too bad.  You're still around and we know you'll come back <i>(...right)</i>, so here, click this button to get a picture of a kitten.</p>
