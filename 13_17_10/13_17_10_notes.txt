Q2: I could, in theory, use tags outside of the DTD, but how any browser would handle them is not standardized.  For instance, they might be ignored and just default to act like <p> or <div>
Q4: Alignment technically depends on the source language used.  L-to-R (like english) defaults to the left, per the W3

Tables:
What is the purpose of the <thead>/<tbody>/<tfooter> tags?  Why not just <th>,<tr>?
	-Allows you to set the size of the table (less than the whole page) and scroll data independently of the headers
		-Using only CSS, which is nice...
<td> is only allowable as a child of <tr>
<caption> MUST be first child of the table

Layout:
	Spacing: Space between cells
	Padding: Space between edge of cell and its content
	Spanning (colspan/rowspan): "For every row you extend through, those rows should not define a cell"
