JS Arrays
	Fun behavior: when I create an Array object (dunno about implicit arrays), I can add by multiple means
		1) Push() (remove with pop())
		2) Straight assignment (a = new Array(); a = "first"; a = "second"; ==> An array with two strings in it)
JS Events
	Only one event for the Document object: onreadystatechange(readystatechange)
	

1. On the cart page:  if they want to click on the item name, raise either a model window with product details (name, caption, description, ratings, etc) [JavaScript, CSS, DHTML]

4. Add a Sales Tax calculation/calculator to the checkout page. [JavaScript]
5. Add a Coupon Redemption code field in the checkout page. [JavaScript, PHP, CSS].   The only Promo code is "PROMO-23".  It takes off 10% of their total.
6. Implement the "Pay Now" Button in the checkout page.   Have it raise a modal dialog that disables the user from interacting with the background page.
