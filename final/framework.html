		<h1> Final Project </h1>
		<h2>An Interactive Restaurant Simulator</h2>
		<h3>Main Content Area</h3>
		<p>
			The core of the website will be a central area which represents the seating area.  It will have a graphical representation of the tables
			and the number of people that can be seated.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this screen, the website will simulate a possible home-screen for a host/hostess.  At random intervals, parties of varying size will arrive.  The
			system will allow the user to assign them to a table by clicking a button and assigning them a table.  After a random(ish) amount of time, they will stand up and leave.  Hopefully they pay first.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tables will be assigned Waiters.  Waiters can be "good" or "bad".  For "bad" waiters, the table will leave quicker, whereas they will stay longer when they have a good waiter.
		</p>
		<h3>Waiters</h3>
		<p>
			The restaurant will have a list of waiters, not all of whom are working on any given night.  There will be a schedule of waiters which can be customized from the website to set who is working at any
			given time.  If a waiter is currently waiting on a table and they are removed from the shift, they will clear their table and be removed when that table is finished.  If I'm feeling ambitious, I might add a
			"kick patrons out" option, where I clear the table and immediately let off the waiter.
		</p>
		<h3>Money</h3>
		<h4>Paying me</h4>
		<p>
			When a table stands up and leaves, they leave behind money.  Waiters then collect this money and it is deposited in the restaurant's account.
		</p>
		<h4>Paying waiters</h4>
		<p>
			Every time a waiter starts a shift, they get paid, because I'm progressive like that.  This money comes from the restaurant's coffers directly.  There are no taxes.  The restaurant is in Somalia.
		</p>
		<h3>Nitty Gritty</h3>
		<p>In order to implement this, I will be using Ruby on Rails.  This will bring with it the advantage of hosting on Heroku for free.  RoR is a ruby-based MVC framework which will allow me to
			work with objects both in the front and the back-end.  There is a strong RoR developer community and there are quite a few open-source components that exist.  Rails is also a common target
			when using the Bootstrap CSS framework, which helps apply a standard look-and-feel across various components.  These also have the benefit of being the tools used at my workplace, so if I want to 
			move into development rather than QA, they will be important tools to have.</p>
