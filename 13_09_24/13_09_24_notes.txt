CSS selectors continued:

Attribute selectors: "[]" with something in it-
	[atr] 		= Any tag with atr set
	[atr=val] 	= Any tag with atr that matches exactly val
	[atr-=val]	= Any tag with atr which is space-separated set of values, where one of them is exactly val
	[atr|=val]	= Any tag with atr which is hyphen-separated set of values which begins with val
	[atr*=val]	= Any tag with atr containing val anywhere in it
Adjacent selector:	 "+"
	Matches a tag which immediately follows the one before it in the CSS rule.
		"p + div" will match any <div> which is directly after any <p>

Measurements:
	em: size relative to font
	ex: size relative to "x" of a font
	
	px: Absolutely 1 screen pixel
	pt: Absolutely 1/72 of an inch
	pc: 1pc = 12pt
	in: inch
	cm: centimeter
	mm: millimeter
	
@-rules
	conditionals to determine which rules are applied to stylesheet
	@media print { rule: value; }
		-This rule will only be applied when the media is a printer
		
Pseudoclasses:
	Subclasses of anchor tag: :link, :visited, :hover, :active (can be multiply declared, but must be in this order)
	There exist others (for instance, :first-line).  Subsets of the CSS attributes are applicable in these pseudoclasses.  Not all can be used.

Positioning elements:
	static: the default.  Elements placed as they are written
	relative: relative to the default (static) location.  Left, right, etc.
	absolute: Relative to container
	fixed: relative to browser window
