Q2: I could, in theory, use tags outside of the DTD, but how any browser would handle them is not standardized.  For instance, they might be ignored and just default to act like <p> or <div>
Q4: Alignment technically depends on the source language used.  L-to-R (like english) defaults to the left, per the W3

Tables:
What is the purpose of the <thead>/<tbody>/<tfooter> tags?  Why not just <th>,<tr>?
	-Allows you to set the size of the table (less than the whole page) and scroll data independently of the headers
		-Using only CSS, which is nice...
<td> is only allowable as a child of <tr>
<caption> MUST be first child of the table

Layout:
	Spacing: Space between cells
	Padding: Space between edge of cell and its content
	Spanning (colspan/rowspan): "For every row you extend through, those rows should not define a cell"

CSS:
	"Rule": The list of property-value pairs associated with a single selector ("label" or "label a")
	"Rule set": A list of CSS rules (probably at the file level?)
	@import url(path/to/asset) [print,screen,list in CSS DTD]
	The cascade will automatically combine multiple factors, including: importance, specificity, origin, source
		Importance: "!important" token will add weight to a rule.  BUT- only IE7+ supports it.
	Selectors: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html (CSS2, but still...)
		"*": matches all elements
		E: matches any E element
		E F: matches any F element which is a descendent of any E
		E > F: matches any F element which is a direct child (first-level) of any E element
		E+F: matches any F element which is directly preceded by sibling element E
		E[foo]: matches any E element with attribute foo set (regardless of value)
		E[foo="bar"]: matches any E element with attribute foo set to value "bar"
	Selectors can be grouped by comma-separating them ("h1, h2, h3 {}")
